# EfficientApriori 

An efficient implementation of the Apriori algorithm. This implementation assumes a set of transactions, one per line, delimited by a ";". 

The algorithm mines the all frequent k-itemsets with pruning for an efficient implementation. 

Implementation is based on R. Agrawal and R. Srikant, “Fast algorithms for mining association rules”, VLDB'94
